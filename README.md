### Getting Started in Codespaces

When you first load your repository in GitHub Codespaces, you need to configure the Python environment before you can run any cells.

Wait for the interface to load until the top left explorer interface looks like the screenshot below.

<img width="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd00361-9cd4-4bf3-9239-ddaebf051344">

Select the `notebooks` folder in the explorer interface.

<img width="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63d9546f-4bf3-4056-943f-ea52a68163bb">

Then select the file `homework.ipynb`.

If the notebook loads looking weird, wait a few seconds, and then click `homework.ipynb` on the left again.
Sometimes this happens if you open the file while the environment is still starting up.

<img width="896" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7bfbd9-cccd-4ab1-b8f4-8dba67b3bb39">

After you have the notebook opened up and it looks normal, click on "Select Kernel" in the top right.

<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8856b7ef-0fc9-4344-a5b4-bdd9e67e5ff3">

This will open up a small menu above the notebook.
Select "Install/Enable suggested extensions".
It may take several seconds for those to be ready.

<img width="922" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebc32a7-abdb-4091-9b5a-1bb99767fd84">

Then select "Python Environments..." from the menu above the notebook.
If that menu disappears, you can click on "Select Kernel" again to bring it back.

<img width="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05713643-2844-4be6-927f-c1e88f4a7ca5">

Then select the global Python installation.
In the screenshot below, it is Python 3.10.13, and it is labeled as "Global Env" to the right.

<img width="905" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f99d6fd-b787-47f6-b0e6-4d50b2d5eb8a">

At this point, you should be ready to run Python code in your notebook.
The button on the right that previously said "Select Kernel" should now say "Python" and the version that you just selected.
And to the left close to the filename, you should see buttons marked "Run All" and "Restart".

### Committing and Pushing to GitHub

After you change your notebook, the file will be marked as changed in the explorer section on the left, and the source control icon will also be badged with a number reflecting the changed files.

<img width="349" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ea76dae-c72a-466e-ac93-72ca09778e65">

Click the source control icon shown below to open the source control interface.

The source control interface will list the changed files.
Click the plus sign next to your notebook file to stage it to be committed.

<img width="339" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65b98409-f08d-49cb-8c15-6b96a705a49c">

After staging your notebook file, type in a brief description of what you changed.

<img width="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb6139a-0fd7-4d75-a089-09eed457243c">

Then click the commit button.

<img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7b2da01-e0c7-408b-a6c5-8a711d1b1ef0">

Then click the "Sync Changes" button to push them back to GitHub.
There will be a popup to confirm.

<img width="538" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d47931-1258-46c2-b221-84c099d190a0">

Click the OK button.

<img width="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12c25cdb-a633-48ed-98f2-7732835a1122">

After pushing, the source control interface should look empty.
You may see a popup window like the screenshot below asking about automatic syncs.

<img width="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4771c739-d12d-4140-81b2-143ff5338e30">

It does not matter what you choose for this homework, since noone else will be committing to your homework repository.
